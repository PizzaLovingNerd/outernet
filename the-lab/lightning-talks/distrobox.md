## Lightning Talk

**Some quick reminders:**

* 3-5 minutes
* Can be done with slides or no slides (we'd love to see you try!)
* You will have access to a projecter and/or a whiteboard
* if you need any props, please let us know!

### Plan

I would like to a talk about DistroBox, which is a tool that lets you run a Linux container (not virtual machine), allowing you to install packages from any distribution on any distribution.

### Slides
- Uses of distrobox
- Creating a container
- Running commands inside the container
- Installing AUR packages in the container
- Exporting the desktop entry
- Launching the software as if it's not even containerized
